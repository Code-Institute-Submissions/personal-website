# Tom Jones Personal Portfolio | First Milestone Project
**Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

This is my Portfolio. I plan to use this site as a platform to showcase me and my current projects but also give an overview of my current skillset and experience, I will present this website to prospective Employers, Recruiters and Collaborators. 
Currently this page only shows a couple lessons i have undertaken so far and some sample repositories which i plan to replace with my own projects.

## UX
### User Stories

| User | User Stories |
| ------ | ------ |
| Employers | As an Employer I want to be able to access recent projects and also to be able to see a CV to get a more in depth view. |
| Recruiters | As a Recruiter I want to be able to download a CV to be able to share with prospective Employers, but i would also like to see what work has been undertaken before so that I can asses who to send CV's to. |
| Collaborators | As a Collaborator I want to see recent and noteworthy Projects that I can easily view code to see if we would be a good match to collaborate. |

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

## Features

Most of the Feature within my Portfolio are using the Bootstrap CSS framework, I have used a few components which use bootstraps jQuery plugins.
 
### Existing Features
- Navbar - I have used one of bootstraps standard Navbars and then edited the code to fit my pages style, the 
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- I need to be able to have my contact form send directly from the form instead of using the mailto: link as this defeats the object of the form.
- I plan to actually replace sample portfolio projects with my own projects instead of other github repositories i have found. 

## Technologies Used

Here is a list of the Technologies i have used throughout my Portfolio.

- [Balsamiq Mockups 3](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - I have used Balsamiq to create my wireframes.
- [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/html/)
    - I use HTML to create the basic structure of my portfolio.
- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
    - CSS give my site its look and style 
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I have implimented the Bootstrap CSS framework to create a responsive mobile-first website, I have used multiple components and
    edited them to fit my needs.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome was used for all of my icons.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
I have currently deployed my Portfolio on GitHub Pages using the master branch. The site will update on all new commits to the master branch. I use 'git commit' to commit to the local repository and the use 'git push' to send ant changed to the master branch. 

You can run this repository locally by pasting `git clone https://github.com/kushberrycream/personal-website.git` into your terminal.
